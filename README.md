# BestRepositories
Simple one Activity app that shows the repos with more stars on GitHub

I'm Using Clean Architecture concepts, with native ViewModel, UseCases, Kodein as an DI lib and other fun concepts.
We have some automated tests too! They are in the usecase and model modules. The UI test is in the app module.
